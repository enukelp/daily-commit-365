# daily-commit-365
Goal: Make at least one meaningful GitHub contribution every day in 2026.

Throughout 2026, I will try to make atleast one meaningful contribution to github every single day. Some basic rules for this are : 

1. No fake commits.
2. Small Progress counts.
3. I can edit or improve my other projects.
4. I can make notes about the things i learn for me to refer to it later.
5. (+more if i can think of any)
